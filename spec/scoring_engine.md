# Scoring Engine Specification

## 1. Overview & Scope

**Goal**: Exhaustively extract, reconcile, and formalize ALL scoring algorithm logic from 
`./deep-docs/scoring-1.md`, `./deep-docs/scoring-2.md`, and `./deep-docs/scoring-3.md`
into ONE canonical, append-only spec for building the scoring engine.

**Sources**:
- `./deep-docs/scoring-1.md` (316 lines) - Detailed algorithm with weights and calculations
- `./deep-docs/scoring-2.md` (280 lines) - Methodology and evidence sources  
- `./deep-docs/scoring-3.md` (345 lines) - Comprehensive specification with schemas

**Target**: This single living artifact (`/spec/scoring_engine.md`)  
**Focus**: Pre-event scoring for crypto projects (Airdrop + Sales scenarios)

**Key Requirements**:
- Extract all scoring components, weights, and normalization rules
- Define feature space with joins to prior engines (early_metrics, investors, etc.)
- Create canonical decision thresholds and override rules  
- Maintain full traceability to source lines
- Build data contracts for scoring input/output

```

## 6. Scoring Design (Components & Architecture)

### Baseline Scoring System

**Two-Stage Architecture**:
1. **Screening Filter** (Boolean): Rapid elimination of unsuitable projects
2. **Scoring Model** (Continuous): Numerical evaluation for remaining candidates

### Stage 1: Screening Filter (Investment Filter + Product Filter + Community Filter)

**Investment Filter**:
```yaml
investment_requirements:
  min_funding_usd: 2000000  # $2M minimum
  funding_stage: ["pre-seed", "seed", "private"] 
  tier1_investor_required: true  # At least one Tier-1 VC
```
*source: scoring-3.md#L1-L4*

**Product Filter**:  
```yaml
product_requirements:
  defi_projects:
    min_tvl_usd: 10000000  # $10M minimum TVL
    tvl_stability_days: 30  # No anomalous spikes in last 30d
  other_categories:
    min_active_addresses_monthly: 10000
    measurable_onchain_activity: true
```
*source: scoring-3.md#L6*

**Community Filter**:
```yaml  
community_requirements:
  official_channels: ["website", "twitter", "discord"]
  update_recency_days: 90  # Updates within last 90 days
  points_program_bonus: true  # Additional positive signal
```
*source: scoring-3.md#L1-L2*

### Stage 2: Multi-Component Scoring Model

**Component Architecture**:
```yaml
scoring_components:
  TVL_block: 
    weight: "<W_TVL>"  # placeholder, e.g., 0.25
    sub_features: ["TVL_level", "TVL_mom_7d", "TVL_mom_30d"]
  
  Investors_block:
    weight: "<W_INVESTORS>"  # placeholder, e.g., 0.25  
    sub_features: ["investor_quality", "co_investor_clique", "funding_amount"]
    
  Social_block:
    weight: "<W_SOCIAL>"  # placeholder, e.g., 0.20
    sub_features: ["engagement_rate", "growth_30d", "bot_share"]
    
  Platform_block:  # Conditional on scenario
    weight: "<W_PLATFORM>"  # placeholder, e.g., 0.20
    airdrop_features: ["llama_airdrops_listed", "points_program_activity"] 
    sales_features: ["launchpad_1Y_ROI", "7d_above_sale_coeff"]
    
  Risk_adjustment:
    weight: "<W_RISK>"  # placeholder, e.g., 0.10
    penalty_features: ["security_incidents", "unlock_heaviness", "wash_trading"]
```
*source: scoring-2.md#L112-L117, scoring-1.md#L35-L69*

### Detailed Component Formulas

**TVL Block** (emphasis on momentum over absolute level):
```yaml
TVL_block_formula: "0.6*TVL_mom_30d + 0.3*TVL_mom_7d + 0.1*TVL_level"
normalization: "Percentile rank within (chain × category) group"
rationale: "TVL growth signals organic adoption; absolute level less predictive"
```
*source: scoring-2.md#L120, scoring-1.md#L35-L37*

**Investors Block** (quality over quantity):
```yaml  
Investors_block_formula: "0.7*investor_quality + 0.3*co_investor_clique"
investor_quality: "Bayesian-smoothed ROI of fund portfolio (alpha=2, beta=8)" 
co_investor_clique: "Indicator of ≥2 top-quartile funds in same round"
```
*source: scoring-2.md#L124, scoring-2.md#L64-L67*

**Social Block** (engagement over growth):
```yaml
Social_block_formula: "0.6*engagement_rate + 0.3*growth_30d + 0.1*discord_growth"
engagement_rate: "(likes+replies+RT)/followers, median of N recent posts"
wash_spike_detection: "Penalize if growth >100% but engagement_rate <0.5%"
```
*source: scoring-2.md#L127, scoring-1.md#L72*

**Platform Block** (scenario-conditional):
```yaml
# For Airdrops
Airdrop_block_formula: "0.6*llama_airdrops_listed + 0.4*points_program_activity"

# For Sales  
Launchpad_block_formula: "0.7*launchpad_1Y_ROI + 0.3*7d_above_sale_coeff"
```
*source: scoring-2.md#L130-L133*

**Risk Adjustment** (penalty-based):
```yaml
Risk_adjustment_formula: "1 - clip(0.5*security_incident + 0.3*unlock_heaviness + 0.2*wash_spike, 0, 1)"
critical_overrides: 
  - security_incident_90d: "Automatic disqualification"
  - community_backlash: "Automatic disqualification"  
  - extreme_unlock: ">P75 of category → -0.3 penalty"
```
*source: scoring-2.md#L136, scoring-1.md#L77-L79*

### Final Score Aggregation
```yaml
final_score_formula: |
  S = <W_TVL> * TVL_block 
    + <W_INVESTORS> * Investors_block 
    + <W_SOCIAL> * Social_block 
    + <W_PLATFORM> * Platform_block
    + <W_RISK> * Risk_adjustment
    
  # Clip to [0, 1] range
  S = clip(S, 0, 1)
```

### Override Rules & Gates

**Hard Override Conditions**:
```yaml
up_overrides:
  fair_launch_adjustment: "If no VC funding, set neutral scores for funding components"
  tier1_syndicate_bonus: "≥2 Tier-1 funds in same round → +0.1 bonus"
  strategic_integrator: "Core ecosystem role → manual +0.1 bonus"
  
down_overrides:
  security_incidents: "Any breach in 90d → automatic rejection"
  community_backlash: "Public complaints about unfair distribution → reject"
  sybil_detection: "Suspicious activity spikes → -0.5 penalty"
```
*source: scoring-3.md#L300-L301, scoring-2.md#L185-L189*

### Ensemble Options (Placeholder)
```yaml
ensemble_architecture:
  baseline: "Weighted linear combination (above)"
  optional_ml_head: "<CALIBRATION_METHOD>" # isotonic/Platt scaling
  regularization: "<REGULARIZATION_TYPE>" # L1/L2 for feature selection
  training_protocol: "Temporal cross-validation on DR corpus"
```

## 7. Thresholds & Decision Policy

  τ_avoid: "<THRESHOLD_AVOID>"  # e.g., <0.50 for No-Go
  
minimum_conditions:
  independent_signals: "≥2 signal classes above screening thresholds"
  critical_features: "No missing values for TVL, funding_stage, engagement_rate"
```

### Current Decision Rules (From Sources)
```yaml
go_conditions:
  score_threshold: "S ≥ 0.60"

no_go_conditions:
  score_threshold: "S < 0.50"
  hard_overrides: "Security incidents, extreme unlock schedules"
  insufficient_data: ">50% missing critical features"
```
*source: scoring-2.md#L177-L181, scoring-3.md#L169-L171*

### Screening Thresholds (Percentile-Based)

screening_criteria:
  # TVL-based (for DeFi projects)
  TVL_level: "[P35, P85]"  # Not too small, not overvalued
  TVL_mom_30d: "≥ P65"     # Strong momentum
  TVL_mom_7d: "≥ P60"      # Recent activity

  # Social/Community  
  engagement_rate: "≥ P60"  # Above-average engagement
  growth_30d: "≥ P60"       # Growing community
  bot_share: "≤ P70"        # Reasonable organic activity
  
  # Investment Quality
  investor_quality: "≥ P55 OR co_investor_clique = true"
  funding_recent: "≤ 9 months before T_event"
  
  # Platform Quality (for Sales)
  launchpad_1Y_ROI: "≥ P60"
  launchpad_7d_success: "≥ median"
  
  # Risk Filters  
  security_incidents: "false"

```
*source: scoring-2.md#L150-L167*

### Sensitivity Analysis & Grid Search Plan
```yaml
sensitivity_testing:
  temporal_windows: 
    lag: [3, 5, 7]  # days before T_event
    evaluation: ["24h", "3d", "7d", "14d"]  # post-event windows
    
  threshold_grid:
    τ_enter: [0.60, 0.65, 0.70, 0.75]
    τ_wait: [0.45, 0.50, 0.55, 0.60] 
    K_top_decile: [5, 10, 15, 20]  # for precision@K
    
  multi_objective_criteria:
    primary: "Maximize precision@K"
    secondary: "Minimize false positive rate"
    tertiary: "Ensure stability across segments"
```
*source: scoring-2.md#L198-L200*

### Tie-Breaking Rules  
```yaml
tie_breaking:
  equal_scores: "Prioritize by investor_quality score"  
  equal_investor_quality: "Prioritize by TVL_momentum"
  borderline_cases: "Favor projects with strong community signals"
  risk_adjusted: "Always prefer lower-risk option when scores similar"
```

## 8. Validation & Backtesting (Temporal, No Leakage)

### Time-Based Validation Design
```yaml
temporal_validation:
  method: "Rolling out-of-time splits"
  training_window: "12 months historical data"
  test_window: "1 month forward"
  minimum_observations: "<N_min>" # e.g., 10 per stratum
  
split_strategy:
  anchor: "Before T_event for each project"
  lookback: "Only use data ≥ EARLY_LAG_MIN_days before T_event"  
  leakage_prevention: "Strict temporal ordering, no future information"
```

bootstrap_confidence:
  method: "Bootstrap resampling for confidence intervals"
  metrics: "Precision@K, recall@threshold, AUC-PR"
  iterations: 1000
```

### Ablation Studies
