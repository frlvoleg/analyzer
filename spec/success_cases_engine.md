## 5. Consolidated Procedures & Algorithms (Parts 1 & 2)

### Case Identification (Enhanced from Part 1)

```
function identify_success_cases_consolidated(time_window):
    # From Part 1: Basic identification
    candidates = collect_events_in_window(time_window)
    
    # Enhanced with Part 2 filters
    for candidate in candidates:
        T_event = resolve_event_date(candidate)
        class_type = classify_event_type(candidate)
        
        # Apply consolidated filters
        if class_type == "airdrop":
            filters = apply_airdrop_filters_case_a(candidate)  # From Part 2
        elif class_type == "token_sale":
            filters = apply_sale_filters_case_b(candidate)     # From Part 2
        elif class_type == "yield":
            filters = apply_yield_filters_case_c(candidate)    # From Part 2
            
        success_probability = calculate_combined_success_rate(filters)

            yield format_success_case(candidate, success_probability)
```

### Combined Success Label Assignment (Parts 1 & 2)

```
function assign_consolidated_success_label(case, price_timeline, filters):
    base_success = assign_basic_success_label(case, price_timeline)  # Part 1
    
    # Enhanced with Part 2 probability scoring
    filter_score = 0
    
    if case.class == "airdrop":
        if case.fdv <= 100_million: filter_score += 0.37  # 37% success rate
        if case.distribution >= 0.10: filter_score += 0.50  # 50% success rate
        if case.unlock_30d == 0: filter_score += 0.28     # 28% success rate

        if 0.05 <= case.tge_float <= 0.20: filter_score += 0.35 # 35% success rate
        
    # Normalize and combine with base success
    probability_score = min(filter_score / 3, 1.0)
    
    return {
        "basic_success": base_success,
        "probability_score": probability_score,
        "combined_confidence": (base_success * 0.6 + probability_score * 0.4)
    }
```

### Sensitivity Analysis Integration (Part 2)

```
function perform_sensitivity_analysis(threshold_ranges):
    # Based on Part 2 analysis (success-cases-2.md#L284-L311)
    results = {}
    
    # FDV sensitivity for airdrops
    for fdv_threshold in [50_million, 100_million, 200_million]:
        success_rate = calculate_success_rate_at_threshold("airdrop", "fdv", fdv_threshold)
        coverage = calculate_coverage_at_threshold("airdrop", "fdv", fdv_threshold)
        results[f"airdrop_fdv_{fdv_threshold}"] = {
            "success_rate": success_rate,
            "coverage": coverage,
            "recommended": fdv_threshold == 100_million  # Part 2 optimum

## 8. Open Questions & Evidence Gaps

### Missing Evidence

1. **Long-term Tracking**: Both parts focus on short-term success (24-72 hours to 30 days)
   - **Gap**: No data on 6-month or 1-year performance sustainability
   - **Impact**: Cannot validate if short-term success translates to long-term value

2. **Geographic/Regulatory Factors**: Sources don't account for regional differences
   - **Gap**: No analysis of regulatory impact on success rates
   - **Impact**: Filters may not apply uniformly across jurisdictions

3. **Market Cycle Dependency**: Analysis covers 12-month period only
   - **Gap**: Unknown performance across bull/bear market cycles
   - **Impact**: Thresholds may need adjustment for different market conditions

### Data Quality Limitations

1. **Survivorship Bias**: Both parts acknowledge but don't fully compensate for bias toward visible/successful projects
2. **Source Consistency**: Price data reconciliation methodology not fully specified
3. **Sample Size**: Some filter combinations have small sample sizes (n<20)

## 9. Test Harness Plan (Placeholders Only)

### Validation Framework

**Test Case Categories**:
1. **Synthetic Airdrop**: Mock project with FDV=$80M, Distribution=15%, Unlock=0%
   - **Expected Result**: 71% success probability (Case A filter match)
   - **Validation**: Check filter logic and probability calculation

2. **Synthetic Token Sale**: Mock IDO with InitialCap=$6M, Tier1 Platform, Float=12%  
   - **Expected Result**: 71% success probability (Case B filter match)
   - **Validation**: Verify platform tier classification and threshold logic

3. **Synthetic Yield Strategy**: Mock pool with TVL=$150M, APY=4%, Rating A stablecoin
   - **Expected Result**: 100% success probability (Case C filter match)
   - **Validation**: Test asset rating integration and risk assessment

4. **Edge Case Testing**: Projects at threshold boundaries
   - **Purpose**: Validate sensitivity analysis accuracy
   - **Method**: Test FDV at $99M vs $101M for airdrops

5. **Historical Validation**: Backtest on known cases from both parts
   - **Known Success Cases**: RICE AI (16.3×), Forest Protocol (7.0×), Hyperliquid (~6.75×)
   - **Known Failure Cases**: Grass (0.82×), Pixels (0.06×)
   - **Validation**: Confirm retrospective filter predictions match actual outcomes

### Event Classes

**Airdrop Class** (source: success-cases.md#L10-L18):
- **Definition**: Free token distribution to community/users
- **Base Price**: Zero-cost (tokens received free)
- **Success Metric**: Any positive USD value retention
- **Examples**: Hyperliquid (~6.75× value growth), Starknet (~1.2× growth)

**Token Sale Class** (source: success-cases.md#L19-L25):
- **Definition**: ICO/IDO/IEO/Launchpad public sales
- **Base Price**: Official sale/allocation price
- **Success Metric**: ROI ≥ 1.0× (price retention) at evaluation window
- **Examples**: Grass (0.82× - failure), Pixels (0.06× - failure)

**Yield Strategy Class** (source: success-cases.md#L461-L470):
- **Definition**: DeFi income generation strategies
- **Base Price**: Expected annual percentage yield (APY)
- **Success Metric**: Actual yield ≥ expected without principal loss

### T_event Resolution Protocol

**Priority Order** (source: success-cases.md#L3):
1. Official TGE announcement date
2. First exchange listing date  
3. First trading/claim availability
4. Airdrop snapshot date (if applicable)

**Time Zone Policy**: UTC standardization for all timestamps

### Success Label Assignment

**Binary Success Classification**:
```yaml
success_criteria:
  airdrop:
    condition: "peak_value_usd > 0 AND retention_30d > baseline"
    baseline: 0  # Zero-cost baseline
    
  token_sale:
    condition: "price_30d >= sale_price * PRIMARY_MULTIPLIER"
    baseline: "sale_price"
    
  yield:
    condition: "actual_apy >= expected_apy AND principal_loss == false"
    baseline: "expected_apy"
```

### Price Reconstruction Protocol

**Multi-Source Resolution** (source: success-cases.md#L5):
1. Primary sources: Major CEX (Binance, Coinbase, OKX)
2. Secondary sources: DEX aggregators (Uniswap, 1inch)
3. Tertiary sources: Price APIs (CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap)
4. Conservative tie-break: Use minimum price for baseline, VWAP for metrics

**Window Metrics Calculation**:
- **Open**: First recorded price in window
- **Peak**: Maximum price achieved in window  
- **VWAP**: Volume-weighted average price
- **Close**: Last recorded price in window

### Data Quality Flags

**Quality Control Indicators**:
- `POST_EVENT_LEAKAGE`: Data includes post-T_event information
- `WASH_TRADING_SUSPECTED`: Unusual volume patterns detected
- `ILLIQUID_PAIRS`: Trading pairs below minimum liquidity thresholds
- `MISSING_TGE`: No clear token generation event identified
- `UNDISCLOSED_PRICE`: Sale price not publicly available
- `CONFLICTING_TIMESTAMPS`: Inconsistent event timing across sources

## 6. Procedures & Algorithms

### Case Identification Procedure

```
function identify_success_cases(time_window):
    candidates = collect_events_in_window(time_window)
    
    for candidate in candidates:
        # T_event resolution
        T_event = resolve_event_date(candidate, priority_order)
        if T_event is null:
            mark_exclusion(candidate, "missing_tge")
            continue
            
        # Class classification  
        class_type = classify_event_type(candidate)
        base_price = determine_base_price(candidate, class_type)
        
        # Price reconstruction
        price_data = collect_price_data(candidate, T_event)
        if not validate_price_data(price_data):
            mark_exclusion(candidate, "insufficient_data")
            continue
            
        # Success label assignment
        success = evaluate_success(candidate, class_type, price_data)
        
        yield format_case_entry(candidate, success)
```

### Price Reconstruction Algorithm

```
function reconstruct_price_timeline(project, T_event):
    sources = [binance, coinbase, okx, uniswap, coingecko]
    price_timeline = {}
    
    for window in [PRIMARY_WINDOW, ALT_WINDOWS]:
        window_start = T_event
        window_end = T_event + window.duration
        
        raw_prices = []
        for source in sources:
            source_data = fetch_price_data(source, project, window_start, window_end)
            if validate_source_data(source_data):
                raw_prices.append(source_data)
        
        if len(raw_prices) < 2:
            flag_quality_issue("insufficient_sources")
            
        # Conservative aggregation
        metrics = calculate_window_metrics(raw_prices)
        price_timeline[window.name] = metrics
        
    return price_timeline
```

### Success Label Assignment

```
function assign_success_label(case, price_timeline):
    if case.class == "airdrop":
        peak_value = price_timeline[PRIMARY_WINDOW].peak_price * tokens_received
        return peak_value > 0  # Any positive value = success
        
    elif case.class == "token_sale":
        final_price = price_timeline[PRIMARY_WINDOW].close_price
        roi = final_price / case.sale_price
        return roi >= PRIMARY_MULTIPLIER
        
    elif case.class == "yield_strategy":
        return (case.actual_apy >= case.expected_apy and 
                case.principal_loss == false)
```

### Bias Control Procedures

**Survivorship Bias Mitigation**:
- Include failed cases proportionally to market reality
- Track and document exclusion reasons
- Maintain "negative examples" dataset for calibration

**Selection Bias Control**:  
- Use systematic sampling across segments and time periods
- Document source coverage limitations
- Flag over-representation of specific platforms/exchanges

**Time-Window Bias Prevention**:
- Evaluate multiple window lengths (24h, 7d, 30d)
- Check sensitivity to window selection
- Document window-dependent results

### Quality Control Procedures

**Schema Validation**:
- Verify all required fields present
- Check data type compliance
- Validate timestamp monotonicity (T_event ≤ price_dates)

**Contradiction Detection**:
- Cross-validate prices across sources (>20% deviation flagged)
- Check volume/liquidity consistency
- Verify event date alignment with external sources

## 7. Reporting Slices & Diagnostics

### Required Rollup Dimensions

**By Time Period**:
- Monthly success rate trends
- Seasonal patterns (if any)
- Market cycle correlations

**By Platform/Exchange**:

    listing_date: completeness_pct
    volume_data: completeness_pct
  optional_fields:
    pre_event_tvl: completeness_pct
    social_metrics: completeness_pct
```

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements

### Reproducibility Constraints

**Deterministic Processing**:
- Fixed random seeds for any sampling operations
- Consistent sorting of tied results
- Stable timestamp handling (UTC, ISO format)

**Version Control**:
- Immutable snapshots of source data at collection time
- Versioned criteria definitions (PRIMARY_MULTIPLIER, etc.)
- Historical preservation of success label assignments

### Auditability Requirements

**Full Traceability**:
- Every case entry traces to specific source lines
- Price data references to original API calls/timestamps
- Success label assignment with complete decision logic

**Evidence Preservation**:
- Original source documents archived
- Price API responses cached with timestamps
- Third-party confirmation data (exchange announcements, etc.)

### Processing SLOs

- **Case identification**: <5 seconds per candidate
- **Price reconstruction**: <30 seconds per case
- **Success evaluation**: <1 second per case

## 10. Contradiction Ledger & Open Questions

### Identified Contradictions

**None major identified** - Source material is internally consistent with clear success/failure examples.

### Open Questions

1. **Dynamic Threshold Adaptation**: Source suggests testing multiple PRIMARY_MULTIPLIER values (2×, 3×, 5×) 
   but doesn't specify selection methodology (source: success-cases.md#L92)

2. **Platform Bias Handling**: Binance Launchpad shows 94% success rate - how to account for 
   platform selection bias in general applicability? (source: success-cases.md#L32)

3. **Cross-Market Validation**: Analysis focused on 12-month period - how stable are patterns
   across different market cycles?

4. **Yield Strategy Timeframes**: DeFi yields evaluated differently than token events - 
   standardization needed for unified success framework
